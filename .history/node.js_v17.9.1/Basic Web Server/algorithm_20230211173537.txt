1. Load the http core module using the require() function.
2. Use the http.createServer() method to create a new server, passing in a callback function that will be called for each incoming request to the server.
3. In the callback function, set the status code and content type of the response using the res.statusCode and res.setHeader() methods.
4. Write the response body using the res.write() or res.end() method.
5. Use the server.listen() method to start the server listening on a specific port.
6. Optionally, log a message to the console to indicate that the server is running and which port it is listening on.
7. Test the server by sending a request to the specified port using a web browser or other HTTP client.
